# AdeClangFormat

This CMake module is a simple and pragmatic helper for running `clang-format` in the context of a CMake build:

```cmake
find_package(AdeClangFormat 1.0 CONFIG REQUIRED)
ade_clang_format_targets(TARGETS
  target1
  target2)
```

This introduces two main new targets (which you can run with `cmake --build <binary-dir> --target <target>`):
- `formatcheck`: Runs `clang-format` on the sources of all specified targets without actually modifying them. The target fails if `clang-format` finds formatting errors.
- `formatfix`: Runs `clang-format` on the sources of all specified targets, asking `clang-format` to fix them.

By default, building the specified target(s) also runs the `clang-format` check to verify the formatting of the target's sources (but that can be turned off; see below). Useful to enforce formatting compliance, such as in a CI build.

The `clang-format` command to run can be specified via the CMake cache variable `ADE_CLANG_FORMAT` (similarly to CMake's [`CMAKE_<LANG>_CLANG_TIDY`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_LANG_CLANG_TIDY.html) cache variable):

```bash
cmake -DADE_CLANG_FORMAT:STRING='clang-format;--style=file:.clang-format' <other-flags>
```

## Full usage

```cmake
ade_clang_format_targets(TARGETS [targets...]
	[BUILD_DEPENDS | NO_BUILD_DEPENDS]
	[COMMAND command [args...]]
	[CHECK_MAIN_TARGET <name>]
	[CHECK_POSTFIX <string>]
	[FIX_MAIN_TARGET <name>]
	[FIX_POSTFIX <string>]
)
```

Sets up check and fix targets that invoke `clang-format` on the sources of the targets specified to `TARGETS`. Note that this function may be invoked multiple times, as long as the same target is not specified again.

The cache variables that influence this call are:

- `ADE_CLANG_FORMAT`: Default value of the `COMMAND` option if unspecified. This is a semicolon-delimited list of flags that run `clang-format`. Works the same way as [`CMAKE_<LANG>_CLANG_TIDY`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_LANG_CLANG_TIDY.html) does. At the moment, this applies to sources of all languages on the specified targets. If unspecified, this variable is considered to be an empty string, which means, if `COMMAND` is also unspecified, that the check and fix targets are created but are a no-op. This is similar to CMake's [`CMAKE_<LANG>_CLANG_TIDY`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_LANG_CLANG_TIDY.html) and is useful to have a single invocation of `ade_clang_format_targets()` that is able to handle both dev/CI setups, which need the formatting targets, _and_ irregular contributors who may not have `clang-format` installed.

- `ADE_CLANG_FORMAT_BUILD_DEPENDS`: A boolean option which, when `ON`, causes invocations of `ade_clang_format_targets()` to default to setting the `BUILD_DEPENDS` option, and, when off, causes invocations of `ade_clang_format_targets()` to default to setting the `NO_BUILD_DEPENDS` option. When unspecified, this variable is considered to be `ON`.

The options are:

- `TARGETS`: The targets whose sources to setup `clang-format` for. Must be existing targets.

- `BUILD_DEPENDS`: Force `clang-format`'s check to be run on the target's sources when the target is built, regardless of the setting of `ADE_CLANG_FORMAT_BUILD_DEPENDS` cache variable.

- `NO_BUILD_DEPENDS`: Force `clang-format`'s check _not_ to be run on the target's sources when the target is built, regardless of the setting of `ADE_CLANG_FORMAT_BUILD_DEPENDS` cache variable.

- `COMMAND`: Force the `clang-format` to be the specified command, regardless of the value of the `ADE_CLANG_FORMAT` cache variable. If both this option and the `ADE_CLANG_FORMAT` cache variable are unspecified, then the check and fix targets are created but are a no-op. This is similar to CMake's [`CMAKE_<LANG>_CLANG_TIDY`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_LANG_CLANG_TIDY.html) and is useful to have a single invocation of `ade_clang_format_targets()` that is able to handle both dev/CI setups, which need the formatting targets, _and_ irregular contributors who may not have `clang-format` installed.

- `CHECK_MAIN_TARGET`: Specify the target that will run the `clang-format` check on the sources of the specified targets. If this is not specified, a default of `formatcheck` is used.

- `CHECK_POSTFIX`: At the moment, AdeClangFormat creates individual `clang-format` check targets for each of the specified targets. These targets' name is `<target-name>${CHECK_POSTFIX}`. If this is not specified, a default of `-formatcheck` is used.

- `FIX_MAIN_TARGET`: Specify the target that will run the `clang-format` fix on the sources of the specified targets. If this is not specified, a default of `formatfix` is used.

- `FIX_POSTFIX`: At the moment, AdeClangFormat creates individual `clang-format` fix targets for each of the specified targets. These targets' name is `<target-name>${FIX_POSTFIX}`. If this is not specified, a default of `-formatfix` is used.
